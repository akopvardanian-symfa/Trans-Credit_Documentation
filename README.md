# TransCredit Documentation

## üìã Project Overview
TransCredit is a comprehensive insurance certificate management system that processes agent reports, manages certificate data, and handles error corrections through an automated workflow. The system currently operates with 95% manual error correction time, requiring modernization to improve efficiency and accuracy.

## üöÄ Quick Start
1. Start: [Complete Documentation](./Project%20Documentation/TransCredit%20-%20Complete%20Documentation.md)
2. Background: [Source Materials](./Source%20Materials/)
3. Interviews (videos): [TransCredit Interviews on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1N_QKk5DJ9l23AWXPAEmVH0KwR5-Nht10)

### `/Process Diagrams/`
- PlantUML and SVG diagrams of business processes.
- `As Is/` ‚Äî current process flow:
  - `TransCredit - As Is.puml`
  - `TransCredit - As Is.svg`
- `To Be/` ‚Äî target architecture/process flows (variants and evolution):
  - `TransCredit - Architecture - To Be.puml/.svg`

### `/Source Materials/`
- Raw inputs and analysis artifacts used to build the target documentation. File purposes:

| File | Purpose | How used in docs |
|---|---|---|
| `TC MVP v1.txt` | Primary MVP source: Technology Stack, Feature List (verbatim), Team, Assumptions, Risks | To Be: Technology Stack; Feature List table (descriptions and estimates); Team Composition; Assumptions; Risks |
| `TransCredit-Technical-Specification-Certificates.txt` | Technical requirements for certificate processing | To Be subsections (import, validations, audits) |
| `TransCredit-Meeting-Transcript-2025_10_28.txt` | Meeting transcript, business context, process clarifications | Business Context and As Is (workflow) |
| `TransCredit - 2025_09_26_17_14_CEST - Recording.txt` | Early requirements gathering session | Validations/errors and agent communications |
| `image.png` | Supporting illustration/artifact | Not linked directly; may be moved into the appropriate section later |

### Repository root
- `README.md` ‚Äî quick overview, structure, and quick start

Note: the `Prototype Overview/` folder was removed; its content was migrated into the Appendix of the Complete Documentation, and SVGs were moved to `/Project Documentation/`.

## üéØ Key Project Information

### Business Context
TransCredit operates within the **credit insurance industry**, managing **credit life and disability insurance** sold through banking channels. The system processes monthly sales reports from banking agents, manages certificate data, and handles complex error corrections.

### Current System (As Is)
- **Technology**: MS Access database with Excel-based interface
- **Process**: Highly manual with extensive error correction (95% of time)
- **Limitations**: Payment schedule restrictions, birthday coverage issues, state regulation complexity

### Target System (To Be)
- **Technology Stack (MVP)**: Blazor (C#), .NET 8 APIs, SQL Server, EF Core, Azure AD (internal), Auth0 (DMZ), Plateau services
- **Process**: Automated error detection, QA verification, agent self-service corrections
- **Feature List (MVP)**: Now presented as a table with descriptions and estimates in the Complete Documentation



## üìä Business Impact

### Current Challenges (As Is)
- **Manual Processes**: 95% of operational time spent on manual error correction
- **Technology Limitations**: Outdated MS Access system with performance issues
- **Limited Automation**: No automated error correction or state rule application
- **Communication Gaps**: No integrated tracking of agent communications
- **System Limitations**: Cannot handle non-monthly payments, birthday coverage, state regulations

### Expected Benefits (To Be)
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce manual correction time from 95% to <20%
- **Financial Accuracy**: Eliminate calculation errors affecting premium amounts
- **Compliance**: Ensure state regulation adherence and audit trail completeness
- **Agent Satisfaction**: Improve communication and reduce billing disputes
- **Technology Modernization**: Web-based platform with enhanced capabilities
- **Agent Self-Service**: DMZ portal for independent error correction
