## 🎯 Key Project Information

### Business Context
TransCredit operates within the **credit insurance industry**, managing **credit life and disability insurance** sold through banking channels. The system processes monthly sales reports from banking agents, manages certificate data, and handles complex error corrections.

### Current System (As Is)
- **Technology**: MS Access database with Excel-based interface
- **Process**: Highly manual with extensive error correction (95% of time)
- **Limitations**: Payment schedule restrictions, birthday coverage issues, state regulation complexity

### Target System (To Be)
- **Technology**: Blazor web application with C# backend services
- **Process**: Automated error correction and agent communication
- **Features**: Enhanced search, comprehensive audit logging, DMZ agent portal

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. **Start with**: [Complete Documentation](./Project%20Documentation/TransCredit%20-%20Complete%20Documentation.md) for comprehensive project overview
2. **Examine**: [Process Diagrams/As Is](./Process%20Diagrams/As%20Is/) for current system
3. **Explore**: [Process Diagrams/To Be](./Process%20Diagrams/To%20Be/) for target architecture
4. **Review**: Source Materials for detailed business process discussions

## 📊 Business Impact

### Current Challenges
- **Manual Processes**: 95% of operational time spent on manual error correction
- **Technology Limitations**: Outdated MS Access system with performance issues
- **Limited Automation**: No automated error correction or state rule application
- **Communication Gaps**: No integrated tracking of agent communications

### Expected Benefits
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce manual correction time from 95% to <20%
- **Financial Accuracy**: Eliminate calculation errors affecting premium amounts
- **Compliance**: Ensure state regulation adherence and audit trail completeness
- **Agent Satisfaction**: Improve communication and reduce billing disputes
