# TransCredit Documentation

## üìã Project Overview
TransCredit is a comprehensive insurance certificate management system that processes agent reports, manages certificate data, and handles error corrections through an automated workflow. The system currently operates with 95% manual error correction time, requiring modernization to improve efficiency and accuracy.

## üéØ Key Project Information

### Business Context
TransCredit operates within the **credit insurance industry**, managing **credit life and disability insurance** sold through banking channels. The system processes monthly sales reports from banking agents, manages certificate data, and handles complex error corrections.

### Current System (As Is)
- **Technology**: MS Access database with Excel-based interface
- **Process**: Highly manual with extensive error correction (95% of time)
- **Limitations**: Payment schedule restrictions, birthday coverage issues, state regulation complexity

### Target System (To Be)
- **Technology**: Blazor web application with C# backend services
- **Process**: Automated error correction and agent communication
- **Features**: Enhanced search, comprehensive audit logging, DMZ agent portal

## üöÄ Quick Start
1. **Start with**: [Complete Documentation](./Project%20Documentation/TransCredit%20-%20Complete%20Documentation.md) for comprehensive project overview
2. **Review**: [Business Context & Processes](./Project%20Documentation/TransCredit%20-%20Complete%20Documentation.md#business-context) for understanding the business
3. **Analyze**: [System Analysis (As Is)](./Project%20Documentation/TransCredit%20-%20Complete%20Documentation.md#system-analysis-as-is) for current state
4. **Explore**: [To Be (Desired State)](./Project%20Documentation/TransCredit%20-%20Complete%20Documentation.md#to-be-desired-state) for target vision
5. **Examine**: [Process Diagrams](./Process%20Diagrams/) for visual representations
6. **Review**: [Source Materials](./Source%20Materials/) for detailed business process discussions

## üìä Business Impact

### Current Challenges (As Is)
- **Manual Processes**: 95% of operational time spent on manual error correction
- **Technology Limitations**: Outdated MS Access system with performance issues
- **Limited Automation**: No automated error correction or state rule application
- **Communication Gaps**: No integrated tracking of agent communications
- **System Limitations**: Cannot handle non-monthly payments, birthday coverage, state regulations

### Expected Benefits (To Be)
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce manual correction time from 95% to <20%
- **Financial Accuracy**: Eliminate calculation errors affecting premium amounts
- **Compliance**: Ensure state regulation adherence and audit trail completeness
- **Agent Satisfaction**: Improve communication and reduce billing disputes
- **Technology Modernization**: Web-based platform with enhanced capabilities
- **Agent Self-Service**: DMZ portal for independent error correction

## üìû Key Stakeholders
- **Ammon**: Project Sponsor, driving modernization effort
- **Tonya Iles**: Operations Team Lead, providing business process insights
- **Ivan Sokolov**: Technical Lead, responsible for development and technical understanding
