## üè¢ Business Context

### Industry Background
**Plateau Group** operates within the **credit insurance industry**, specifically managing **credit life and disability insurance** sold through banking channels. This type of insurance protects borrowers and their families in case of death or disability, ensuring loan repayment.

**TransCredit** is the internal system used by Plateau Group to process monthly reports from financial institution agents and manage certificate data.

### Business Model: How Insurance Works with Agents

#### Who are Agents in Plateau Group Context
**Agents** in this context are **financial institutions** (including banks, credit unions, and other lending organizations) that sell credit insurance to their customers when they take out loans. These are not individual insurance agents, but rather **institutions** that have agreements with Plateau Group to offer credit insurance products to their loan customers.

#### How the Insurance Business Works
1. **Customer takes a loan** from a financial institution (agent)
2. **Institution offers credit insurance** to protect the loan in case of death or disability
3. **Customer purchases insurance** as part of their loan package
4. **Institution collects premium** from customer along with loan payments
5. **Institution submits monthly reports** to Plateau Group with all insurance sales
6. **Plateau Group processes** the insurance certificates and manages the policies

#### Where TransCredit Fits In
**TransCredit** is the **internal processing system** used by Plateau Group to handle the monthly reports from financial institution agents. It's the system that Plateau Group uses to:
- **Receive monthly sales reports** from financial institutions showing all insurance sold
- **Process certificate data** for each insurance policy
- **Validate and correct errors** in the data submitted by institutions
- **Manage financial reconciliation** between what institutions sold and what they owe
- **Handle agent communication** when errors need to be corrected

### Current System Scope
The **TransCredit system** (used by Plateau Group) handles:
- **Monthly Sales Reports** from financial institution agents containing certificate data
- **Certificate Processing** including data entry, validation, and error correction
- **Financial Balancing** between agent reports and premium remittances
- **Agent Communication** for error resolution and billing adjustments
- **Compliance Management** ensuring adherence to state regulations and audit requirements

## üìä Business Processes

### Current Business Process (As Is)

#### Process Diagram
![TransCredit Current Process](./TransCredit%20-%20As%20Is.svg)

#### Monthly Report Processing Workflow

Here is the detailed step-by-step process:

##### 1. Receive Monthly Sales Report
Banks and credit unions send monthly reports showing how many insurance policies they sold. The report contains: who bought insurance, how much they paid, what health information they provided. It also shows how much money the bank owes Plateau Group for the sold insurance policies.

##### 2. Assign Report Number and Description
Staff member logs into TransCredit system, creates a new report record and assigns it a number. The staff member gives the report an internal name based on how it was received:

- **Manual processing**: "August Bath" (month + city where bank is located)
- **Electronic payment**: "August ER" (month + "ER" for e-remit system)
- **Website upload**: "August Upload" (month + "Upload" for website submission)

This internal naming helps staff immediately identify how each report was received and processed.

##### 3. Enter Certificate Information into TransCredit System
Staff member enters data for each insurance certificate into the system. If a certificate has no number (bank's printing problem), they use the last 4 digits of SSN. They notify agent services about the printing issue so they can contact the bank and fix the printing problem.

**Important**: Data is entered exactly as printed, even if they know it's wrong.

##### 4. Check Health Questions Status
Staff member checks if the customer answered health questions and sets a system code in TransCredit:
- **Code "1"**: Health questions answered
- **Code "3"**: Health questions NOT answered (triggers system error)

For disability insurance, ALL health questions must be answered before the policy can be processed.

##### 5. Run Snapshot Validation
Staff member clicks "Run Snapshot" button and system checks all certificates for errors:
- Is customer too old for insurance
- Is premium calculated correctly
- Is coverage amount correct
- Is refund method correct (pro-rata or Rule 78)
- Bank platform errors
- Printing errors (extra premiums)
- Limit violations

##### 6. Error Processing (95% of work time)
If errors are found, the most time-consuming part begins. Staff spend 95% of time fixing errors that banks make. Errors happen because:
- Bank employee entered data incorrectly in their system
- Bank's system works incorrectly
- Bank's platform cannot help

When fixing errors:
1. **View error list**
2. **Enter data exactly as bank submitted** (even if they know it's wrong)
3. **Balance to original amounts** (critically important - before corrections)
4. **Create exception report** (what they changed)
5. **Update system with correct amounts**
6. **Print updated error list**
7. **Generate billing for bank** (how much they owe or get back)
8. **Notify bank of changes** (billing + explanations + customer letters)

##### 7. Run Over Limits Check
Staff member clicks "Run OLIST" button and system checks if customer exceeds coverage limits. For example, if customer already has $50,000 insurance and bank sold another $60,000, then the $100,000 limit is exceeded.

If limit exceeded:
- **Contact bank** - is old insurance still active
- **Reduce new coverage** if both are active
- **Notify customer of reduction** (legal requirement)
- **Bank can keep new insurance** if they cancel old one

##### 8. Print Report
Print main report with financial balance.

##### 9. Print Customer List
Print list of all customers in the report.

##### 10. Scan All Documents Together
Scan all documents together for archive:
- Report
- Customer list
- All supporting documents

##### 11. Complete Monthly Report Processing
Monthly report processing is completed.

### Error Correction Process (Detailed)

#### Common Error Types
1. **Age Limit Violations**: Customers too old for insurance
2. **Premium Calculation Errors**: Wrong amounts calculated by agents
3. **Coverage Amount Mistakes**: Incorrect coverage amounts
4. **Refund Method Errors**: Wrong refund calculations (pro-rata vs Rule 78)
5. **Platform Provider Errors**: System issues with agent platforms
6. **Printing Errors**: Extra premiums or incorrect data
7. **Multiple Policy Violations**: Exceeding agent coverage limits

#### Error Correction Workflow
1. **Identify Errors**: Through snapshot validation
2. **Input Original Data**: Enter exactly as agent submitted
3. **Balance to Original**: Must balance to original report numbers
4. **Make Corrections**: Apply correct calculations
5. **Document Changes**: Create exception report
6. **Notify Agent**: Send billing statement and explanations
7. **Notify Customer**: If life/disability/AD&D changed (legal requirement)
